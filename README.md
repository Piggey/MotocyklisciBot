# MotocyklisciBot
A simple Twitter bot that uploads pictures everyday, making fun out of Motocyklisci since 2018 :)

# How does it work?
It loads the links from the __images.txt__ file, then picks a random link, downloads the image and uploads it using __tweepy__ Twitter API.

I tried to upload it on heroku, but for some reason the uploading of the images does not seem to work. There's probably something wrong with downloading the images from the link using requests.

I have literally no idea how to fix it for now though.

# help.
